**Graphix** is a measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) software package, featuring
- the measurement calculus framework with integrated graphical rewrite rules for Pauli measurement preprocessing
- circuit-to-pattern transpiler, graph-based deterministic pattern generator and manual pattern generation
- flow- and gflow-based graph visualization tools
- statevector and tensornetwork pattern simulation backends
- QPU interface and fusion network extraction tool

## Installation
Install `graphix` with `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install graphix
```

Install together with device interface:
```bash
$ pip install graphix[extra]
```
this will install `graphix` and inteface for [IBMQ](https://github.com/TeamGraphix/graphix-ibmq) and [Perceval](https://github.com/TeamGraphix/graphix-perceval) to run MBQC patterns on superconducting and optical QPUs and their simulators.


## Using graphix

### generating pattern from a circuit
```python
from graphix import Circuit
circuit = Circuit(4)
circuit.h(0)
...
pattern = circuit.transpile()
pattern.draw_graph()
```

<small>note: this graph is generated from QAOA circuit, see [our example code](examples/qaoa.py). Arrows indicate the [*causal flow*](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.74.052310) of MBQC and dashed lines are the other edges of the graph. the vertical dashed partitions and the labels 'l:n' below indicate the execution *layers* or the order in the graph (measurements should happen from left to right, and nodes in the same layer can be measured simultaneously), based on the partial order associated with the (maximally-delayed) flow. </small>

### preprocessing Pauli measurements
```python
pattern.perform_pauli_measurements()
pattern.draw_graph()
```
<img src="https://github.com/TeamGraphix/graphix/assets/33350509/3c30a4c9-f912-4a36-925f-2ff446a07c68" alt="logo" width="140">

<small>(here, the graph has [*generalized flow*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/9/8/250).)</small>

### simulating the pattern
```python
state_out = pattern.simulate_pattern(backend='statevector')
```

Update on the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11975.pdf): [^1]

[^1]: Following the release of this arXiv preprint, we were made aware of [Backens et al.](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-03-25-421/) and related work, where graph-theoretic simplification (Pauli measurement elimination) of patterns were shown.
Many thanks for letting us know about this work - at the time of the writing we were not aware of these important relevant works but will certainly properly mention in the new version; we are working on significant restructuring and rewriting of the paper and hope to update the paper soon.
