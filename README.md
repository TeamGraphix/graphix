**Graphix** is an open-source library to optimize and simulate measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC). 

## Feature

- We integrate an efficient [graph state simulator](https://graphix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lc-mbqc.html) as an optimization routine of MBQC *measurement pattern*, with which we can classically [preprocess all Pauli measurements](https://graphix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#performing-pauli-measurements) (corresponding to the elimination of all Clifford gates in the gate network - c.f. [Gottesman-Knill theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottesmanâ€“Knill_theorem)), significantly reducing the required size of graph state to run the computation.
- We implement Matrix Product State (MPS) simulation of MBQC with which thousands of qubits (graph nodes) can be simulated with modest computing resources (e.g. laptop), without approximation.
- Our pattern-based construction and optimization routines are suitable for high-level optimization to run quantum algorithms on MBQC quantum hardware with minimal resource state size requirements. We plan to add quantum hardware emulators (and quantum hardware) as pattern execution backends.
