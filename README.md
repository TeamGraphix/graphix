**Graphix** is a measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) compiler, which makes it easier to generate, optimize and simulate MBQC *measurement patterns*.

## Feature

- We integrate an efficient [graph state simulator](https://graphix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lc-mbqc.html) as an optimization routine of MBQC *measurement pattern*, with which we can classically [preprocess all Pauli measurements](https://graphix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#performing-pauli-measurements) (corresponding to the elimination of all Clifford gates in the gate network - c.f. [Gottesman-Knill theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottesmanâ€“Knill_theorem)), significantly reducing the required size of graph state to run the computation.
- We implement tensor-network simulation of MBQC with which thousands of qubits (graph nodes) can be simulated with modest computing resources (e.g. laptop), without approximation.
- Our pattern-based construction and optimization routines are suitable for high-level optimization to run quantum algorithms on MBQC quantum hardware with minimal resource state size requirements. We plan to add quantum hardware emulators (and quantum hardware) as pattern execution backends.

## Installation
Install `graphix` with `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install graphix
```

## Next Steps

- We have a few [demos](https://graphix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html) showing basic usages of `Graphix`.

Update on the paper: [^1]

[^1]: Following the release of this arXiv preprint, we were made aware of a previous work by [Backens et al.](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-03-25-421/) where Pauli measurement elimination method for MBQC was developed in the context of circuit optimization. 
Many thanks for letting us know about this work, we will properly mention this work in the next version of our paper.
