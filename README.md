**Graphix** is a measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) compiler to generate, optimize and simulate MBQC *measurement patterns*.

## Feature

- We integrate an efficient [graph state simulator](https://graphix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lc-mbqc.html) as an optimization routine of MBQC *measurement pattern*, with which we can classically [preprocess all Pauli measurements](https://graphix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#performing-pauli-measurements) (corresponding to the elimination of all Clifford gates in the gate network - c.f. [Gottesman-Knill theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottesmanâ€“Knill_theorem) and more general pattern rewriting method based on [ZX diagram rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01664)), reducing the required size of graph state to run the computation.
- We implement tensor-network simulation backend for MBQC with which thousands of qubits (graph nodes) can be simulated with modest computing resources (e.g. laptop), without approximation.
- We are developing density matrix simulation backend for noisy MBQC simulations with customizable noise models.

## Installation
Install `graphix` with `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install graphix
```

Install together with device interface:
```bash
$ pip install graphix[extra]
```
this will install `graphix` and inteface for [IBMQ](https://github.com/TeamGraphix/graphix-ibmq) and [Perceval](https://github.com/TeamGraphix/graphix-perceval) to run MBQC patterns on superconducting and optical QPUs and their simulators.

<!-- We are currently adding more quantum device interface.
Please suggest in [issues](https://github.com/TeamGraphix/graphix/issues) if you have any particular device in mind! -->


## Next Steps

- We have a few [demos](https://graphix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html) showing basic usages of `Graphix`.

Update on the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11975.pdf): [^1]

[^1]: Following the release of this arXiv preprint, we were made aware of [Backens et al.](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-03-25-421/) and related work, where graph-theoretic simplification (Pauli measurement elimination) of patterns were shown.
Many thanks for letting us know about this work - at the time of the writing we were not aware of these important relevant works but will certainly properly mention in the new version; we are working on significant restructuring and rewriting of the paper and hope to update the paper this autumn.
